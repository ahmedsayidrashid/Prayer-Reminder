# List of TODO's

API offers multiple endpoints beyond `timingsByAddress`, be able to use those instead of address and date. (such as gps location for precise timing measurements).

Allow users to configure parameters for API endpoints such as location

Offer a CLI via `argparse` to configure your personal prayer tracking tool

Use a simple web framework (Flask, Django) to configure the tool and track prayers

Track ack signals in database, and allow users to go back to day to determine if prayer was prayed in time (progress over time).

Use scheduler to determine run script on a schedule (not forever lol).
